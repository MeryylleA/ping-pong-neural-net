# Ping Pong Game with Neural Networks

This project is a ping pong game where both players are controlled by neural networks. The neural networks are implemented using PyTorch and have a continuous learning and reinforcement learning system.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a simple game environment where neural networks can learn and improve their performance over time through continuous learning and reinforcement learning.

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/githubnext/workspace-blank.git
   cd workspace-blank
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the game:
   ```
   python game.py
   ```

## How to Train the Neural Networks

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/githubnext/workspace-blank.git
   cd workspace-blank
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Train the neural networks:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```

4. The trained models will be saved in the `models` directory.
