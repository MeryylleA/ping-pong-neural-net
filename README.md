# Ping Pong Game with Neural Networks

This project is a ping pong game where both players are controlled by neural networks. The neural networks are implemented using PyTorch and have a continuous learning and reinforcement learning system.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a simple game environment where neural networks can learn and improve their performance over time through continuous learning and reinforcement learning.

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/githubnext/workspace-blank.git
   cd workspace-blank
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the game:
   ```
   python game.py
   ```

## How to Train the Neural Networks

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/githubnext/workspace-blank.git
   cd workspace-blank
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Train the neural networks:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```

4. The trained models will be saved in the `models` directory.

## Error Handling Improvements

The code has been updated to include error handling for various parts of the game and neural network training process. This includes error handling for:
- Pygame initialization and screen creation
- Paddle and ball creation
- Event handling in the main game loop
- Sprite updates and collision checks
- Screen updates and frame rate capping
- Tensor creation in the `train` method
- Model forward pass in the `train` method
- Loss calculation and backpropagation in the `train` method
- Optimizer step in the `train` method
- Neural network initialization
- Game object initialization
- Training loop
- Action retrieval from neural networks
- Player and ball updates
- Collision checks and reward calculation
- Model saving

## Bug Fixes and Significant Improvements

The code has also been updated to fix bugs and implement significant improvements in the game and neural network training process. These improvements include:
- Improved collision detection and handling
- Enhanced reward calculation logic
- Optimized neural network training process
- Better handling of edge cases and unexpected situations
